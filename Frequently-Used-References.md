# Frequently Used References (FUR)

## What is this?

While taking notes, I noticed I'll frequently refer to the same source. This happens when I'm referring to a book that usually contains a lot of knowledge so its reference can be potentially needed in many topics. I can certainly write the reference every time, but that becomes a burden and "duplicated code".

This "frequently used references" (FUR) tries to catch such references. By putting them here, I only need to mention the reference numbers in the notes.

## IDs

Unlike other "local" references, the frequently used references are indexed in the format of `[FUR-id]` where `id` is an identity of the reference. Note that `id` can be as simple as a number, but can also be a string if appropriate. The idea is I want to make the ID system extensible and manageable.

Note that if a document already has a globally recognized ID, such as the RFC documents, I won't develop my own ID.

(TODO: I need to learn the commonly used citation formats.)
